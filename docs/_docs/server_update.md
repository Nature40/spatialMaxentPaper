New Versions of RSDB are available as releases.

## automatic update

In RSDB releases included is the script file `github_update.sh`. 

When you run it, the latest package is downloaded, folders/files are replaced: `lib`, `webcontent`, `rsdb.jar` and backup of old files/folders is placed in folder `backup`. Other folders/files are not changed. The remaining files of the downloaded release are left in folder `update` for the case that you want to replace some further files/folders.

~~~ bash
# First stop a running RSDB server and then execute following update script.
