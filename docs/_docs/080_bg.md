The issue on the optimal sampling size and distribution of background points remains a major challenge in SDM and we will not go into more detail here. Since our study is merely about comparison between modelling approaches than about calculating ecologically meaningful SDMs, we argue that as long as modelling conditions are held constant between the different approaches, a comparison will be possible. Thus, we decided to use 10,000 background points for each area but not distribute them randomly over the whole study area. Instead we used conditioned latin hypercube sampling (CLHS) (Minasny & McBratney, 2006) as implemented in the R package “clhs” (Roudier, 2011).  The conditioned latin hypercube sampling distributes the points in a way over the study area that all variables of the environmental data are represented as well as possible.
